## What is Heyy?

Heyy is an **AI-powered customer messaging platform for building agents that automate conversations**.  

You create agents that act like **digital employees**, each assigned to achieve a clear business goal. Examples:  

- **Support agent** â€” Troubleshoots common problems, resolves issues, and reduces ticket volume so your support team can focus on complex cases.  
- **Sales agent** â€” Qualifies leads, shares relevant product details, and routes high-intent prospects to sales, shortening the conversion path.  
- **Onboarding agent** â€” Walks new users through setup steps and tutorials, increasing activation and reducing churn.  
- **Internal agent** â€” Gathers customer data, routes requests to the correct team, or integrates with tools to speed internal workflows.  
- **Retention agent** â€” Sends renewal reminders, follows up after purchases, or recovers abandoned carts to protect recurring revenue.  

Heyy lets you manage a team of these agents so your messaging strategy mirrors how a real business operates: specialized roles, clear responsibilities, measurable outcomes.
