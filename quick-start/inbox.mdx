# Getting Started with Your Inbox

The Inbox is where you see and work on conversations. It also lets you jump between teams, users, and channels so you can focus on the chats that matter right now.

---

## A. Left Sidebar

### 1.  Inbox
Use these quick filters to scope the list of conversations in the middle panel.

- **My Inbox**  
  Shows conversations currently assigned to you. Ideal daily view for staying on top of your own queue.

- **All**  
  Shows every conversation you have permission to see (across teams/channels visible to you). Use when you want the full picture.

- **Unassigned**  
  Conversations with no owner yet. Pick from here to take ownership and reduce wait time for customers.

:::tip
The small number badges show how many conversations match each filter.

### 2.  Teams
A list of your workspace teams (e.g., Support Team, Sales Team).  

Click a team to filter the middle panel to conversations owned by—or routed to—that team. Helpful when triaging by responsibility area.

---

### 3.  Users
A list of individual users in your workspace.  

Click a user to see conversations assigned to that person. Perfect for load balancing or covering for someone.

---

### 4.  Channels
All connected channels, such as:

- Company A – WhatsApp  
- Company A – Instagram  
- Company A – Website Chat  

Select a channel to see only the conversations coming from that source. Great when you’re monitoring a specific entry point.

---

## B.  Main Workspace

This is the center panel where you browse and work on conversations.

---

### 1.  Viewing & Managing Active Chats
- Selecting a chat from the list opens it directly in the main workspace.  
- You’ll see the conversation timeline and, when available, a reply composer to respond.  
- Use **Notes** and **Labels** from the right details panel to stay organized while handling conversations.

---

### 2.  Opening a New Chat
- Click **Open New Chat** in the center when no thread is selected.  
- Choose a channel (if prompted), pick an existing contact or create a new one, then draft your first message.  
- The new conversation appears in the list and in your **My Inbox** if you’re the assignee.

---

### 3.  Sorting, Filtering & Search
At the top of the conversation list, you’ll find several quick controls:

- **Conversation Status filters:**
  - **Open** → Active conversations awaiting action.  
  - **Closed** → Completed conversations (resolved, archived, or no further action needed).  
  - **Snoozed** → Temporarily paused conversations that will reappear later.  
  - **Unread** → Conversations you haven’t opened yet.  

- **Sorting options:**  
  - **Newest** → Most recent activity at the top (default for real-time work).  
  - **Oldest** → Longest-waiting conversations at the top (useful for SLAs).  

- **Search box:** Quickly find conversations by typing a contact name, phone, email, or keyword.  

- **Filter icon:**  
  Click the small filter icon to apply advanced filtering. You can filter by parameters like first name, last name, phone number, labels, and more.  

> _Note_
_For even more control, you can use logic-based filters (e.g., `contacts with label = VIP AND last name = Smith`) to refine results._

---

## C.  Right Details Panel

Context and controls for the selected conversation and contact.

---

### 1.  Chat Data
- **Assignee** → Who owns the conversation. Click to assign to yourself or reassign to a teammate.  
- **Team** → Which team the conversation belongs to. Click to move the chat to the right team for handling.

---

### 2.  Contact Data
Key details for the person you’re chatting with. Fields shown include:  
**First name, Last name, Phone number, Email**.  

Click **See all** (when visible) to view or edit additional contact fields.

---

### 3.  Contact Labels
Labels help segment contacts and make future filtering easier (e.g., **VIP, Bug report, Billing**).  

Click the ➕ icon to add one or more labels.

---

### 4.  Notes
Internal-only notes for your team.  

Use notes to record context, decisions, or next steps.  

> _Note_
_Notes do **not** send anything to the contact._

---

### 5.  Other Chats
Shows the contact’s other conversations (possibly across different channels).  

Open any item to review history before replying—this reduces repeated questions and gives you continuity.
