## 1.  Send Message
The **Send Message** action allows you to send a plain text WhatsApp message to a contact.

This is the most basic form of WhatsApp communication in workflows and is typically used for simple updates, notifications, confirmations, or conversational messages.  
It supports only text and media (images, video or documents), without additional interactive elements like buttons or lists.

**Use case examples:**
- Sending an order confirmation message  
- Sending a reminder or quick notification to a customer

## 2.  Send Buttons
The **Send Buttons** action allows you to send a WhatsApp message with up to **3 interactive buttons**.  
These buttons give users clear ways to respond or take action, reducing the need to type manually.

### Types of Buttons
- **Quick Reply Buttons**: Predefined text responses that are instantly sent back when tapped.  




### Context and Limitations
- Maximum of **3 buttons per message**  
- Designed for short, action-oriented interactions  
 

**Use case examples:**
- Quick Reply: Offering **“Confirm,” “Reschedule,” or “Cancel”** appointment options

## 3.  Send List
The **Send List** action allows you to send a WhatsApp message with a list of up to **10 reply options**.

List are similar to buttons but offer more options and room for descriptions and category grouping.  
They are especially useful when you want to present more than 3 options without cluttering the chat.  
Users select one item from the list, and only that choice is sent back as their response.

### Context and Limitations
- Maximum of **10 items per list**  

- Best suited for menus or when structured navigation is needed  

**Use case examples:**
- Presenting a service menu (e.g., **“Billing,” “Technical Support,” “Sales”**)  
- Offering a product selection with multiple categories  
- Providing a structured list of FAQs for users to choose from

## 4.  Send Template
The **Send Template** action allows you to send a WhatsApp message using a **pre-approved message template**.

Message templates are required when initiating a conversation with a customer who hasn’t messaged you first.  
They act as the entry point for WhatsApp messaging flows and ensure compliance with Meta’s policies.

### Approval Process and Context
- Templates must be **approved by Meta** before use  
- Approval usually takes just a few seconds to a minute (It can take up to 24 hours in some cases).  
- Once approved, templates can be reused across multiple campaigns or workflows  
- Templates can include **variables, media (images, documents, videos), and buttons (quick replies, URLs, phone numbers)**  

### Why It Matters
WhatsApp enforces template usage to prevent spam and ensure quality communication.  
By using templates, businesses can reach out proactively while staying compliant.

**Use case examples:**
- Sending order shipment notifications  
- Sharing booking confirmations with dynamic details (**date, time, location**)  
- Re-engaging customers with promotional offers or reminders
