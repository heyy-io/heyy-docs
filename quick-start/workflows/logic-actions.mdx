## 1.  Set Variable
The **Set Variable** action allows you to assign a value to a **workflow variable**.

Variables are placeholders that store information during a workflow, and you can define them at any point.  
With this action, you assign a value to an existing variable or create a new one on the fly.

**Use case examples:**
- Storing a contact’s **first name, last name, email, or phone number** into a workflow variable  
- Saving a user’s response (e.g., **“preferred delivery time”**) for later use in the workflow  
- Initializing a variable with a **default value**  

---

## 2.  Clear Workflow Variable
The **Clear Workflow Variable** action removes the stored value of a workflow variable.

This resets the variable, making it empty or undefined for the remainder of the workflow unless assigned again.

**Use case examples:**
- Clearing temporary variables after they are no longer needed  
- Resetting **session-based data** before starting a new flow for the same contact  
- Ensuring outdated values (e.g., old **cart information**) don’t interfere with a new session  

<Note>
When using workflow variables, keep in mind that they are session-based. This means they are reset each time the workflow is triggered or run, preventing data from carrying over between sessions.

## 3.  Condition
The **Condition** action allows you to define **branching logic** within a workflow.

Conditions check whether specific rules are met (e.g., variable values, user attributes, or workflow state).  
Based on the results, the workflow can continue along different paths.

### How It Works
- Add one or more **if/else conditions**  
- Each condition can check a variable, input, or attribute  
- Define actions for when the condition is **true (IF)** and when it is **false (ELSE)**  

**Use case examples:**
- If **contact’s subscription status = active**, send premium content; else, prompt them to subscribe  
- If **cart value > $100**, trigger a discount offer; else, continue checkout flow  
- Route contacts to different support teams based on their **selected department**

## 4.  Trigger Workflow
The **Trigger Workflow** action allows you to start a different, predefined workflow from within the current one.

This makes workflows **modular and reusable**, as you can break down complex automations into smaller flows and call them when needed.

**Use case examples:**
- Triggering a **welcome workflow** after a new user subscribes  
- Starting a **payment verification workflow** during checkout  
- Linking multiple workflows together to handle **multi-step processes**  

---

## 5.  Delay
The **Delay** action pauses the workflow for a specified period before moving to the next step.

You can set either a **fixed delay** (e.g., 30 seconds, 5 minutes, 1 day) or a **randomized delay** within a given range to create natural timing.

**Use case examples:**
- Adding a **30-second delay** before sending a follow-up message, making the response feel natural  
- Waiting **1 day** before sending a reminder message  
- Randomizing delays between **2–5 minutes** to stagger message delivery across contacts  

---

## 6.  Randomizer
The **Randomizer** action splits the workflow into multiple paths, with each path selected based on **probability**.

You can define the number of paths and assign probabilities to each.  
The total probability across all paths must equal **100%**.

**Use case examples:**
- Running **A/B tests** by randomly assigning contacts to different message variations  
- Distributing leads across different sales agents in a randomized way  
- Creating multiple **engagement sequences** and rotating them randomly to avoid repetition
