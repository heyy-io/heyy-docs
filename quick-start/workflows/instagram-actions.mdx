## 1.  Send Message
The **Send Message** action allows you to send a plain text message to a contact on Instagram.

This is the most basic way to communicate through Instagram Direct Messaging.  
It is typically used for quick replies, confirmations, or short updates. You can add up to 13 quick replies and one-time buttons that dissapear once you tap on them.

**Use case examples:**
- Sending a thank-you message after someone engages with your page  
- Providing a short response to a frequently asked question  
- Delivering a quick order or booking confirmation
