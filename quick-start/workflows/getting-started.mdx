The **Workflows** tab is where you automate contact interactions in Heyy. Workflows let you create smart rules that automatically trigger actions when certain conditions are met.

---

## Understanding Workflows

### What Are Workflows?

Workflows are automated sequences that activate when specific conditions happen. Instead of handling everything manually, you can set rules that tell Heyy what to do in different situations.

With workflows, you can:

- Send automated replies to common questions  
- Automatically route chats to the right person or team  
- Keep follow-ups consistent without manual effort  
- Standardize how your team handles interactions  

---

### Workflow Components

Every workflow includes four main parts:

- **Trigger**: The event that starts the workflow  
- **Channel**: The space where it runs (e.g., Heyy Demo channel)  
- **Actions**: What the workflow does once triggered  
- **Status**: Whether it’s active (live) or still being worked on (draft)  

---

## Workflow Management Interface

### Left Sidebar Views

The left sidebar organizes all workflows into easy-to-navigate categories:

- **All Workflows**: Shows everything you’ve created in one place  
- **When Chat Opens**: Workflows that start the moment a new chat begins  
- **When Chat Closes**: Workflows that run at the end of a conversation  
- **When Chat Assigned**: Workflows that trigger when a chat is assigned to someone  
- **Reusable**: Templates that can be applied across different use cases  

---

### Main Workflow Table

The main panel displays your workflows in a table with clear details:

- **Name**: The title or identifier of the workflow  
- **Trigger Type**: What activates it (e.g., When Chat Opens, Reusable)  
- **Trigger Channel**: The channel it’s tied to  
- **Status**: Whether it’s live or still in draft  
- **Created At**: The creation date for quick tracking  
- **Actions**: A menu (⋯) with options to edit, duplicate, or delete workflows  

---

### Search and Filter

Finding workflows is simple with built-in tools:

- **Search Bar**: Look up workflows instantly by name  
- **Sorting**: Organize by trigger type, status, or date created  
- **Sidebar Filters**: Jump between workflow categories using views

## Creating New Workflows

### Getting Started

To create a workflow:

1. Click **Create New Workflow** in the top-right corner of the page.  
2. Choose a trigger to start with.

_It's recommended to begin with **Reusable**, as it gives you a flexible template for multiple situations._

### Trigger Types Explained

- **Reusable**: A template trigger you can use across different scenarios. Ideal for building once and applying multiple times.  
- **When Chat Opens**: Triggered automatically when a new chat is started. Useful for welcome messages or first-response automations.  
- **When Chat Assigned**: Fires when a chat is assigned to a user or a team. Useful for routing chats correctly, notifying assignees, or standardizing handovers.  
- **When Chat Closes**: Activates when a conversation ends. Often used for closing surveys, follow-ups, or summaries.

## Import and Export Functions

The **Import** button lets you bring in workflows from other places. Useful when:

- Using pre-built templates to save time  
- Transferring workflows between accounts  
- Restoring workflows from a backup  
- Importing workflows shared by teammates  

### Export Workflows

You can export workflows from the actions menu (⋯) to:

- Backup your setup safely

## Why Workflows Matter

The **Workflows** tab gives you the power to:

- Automate routine tasks so your team can focus on complex issues  
- Respond instantly and consistently to customer needs  
- Organize customer interactions across teams and channels  
- Scale your customer service without adding unnecessary overhead  

> _Tip_
_Start small with **Reusable workflows**, and build out more automation as you get comfortable. Over time, you'll have a system that handles repetitive tasks automatically, leaving your team to focus on meaningful conversations._
