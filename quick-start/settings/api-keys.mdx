## Creating API Keys

To integrate Heyy with third-party applications, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Key">
    Click the **\+ Create API key** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Key">
    Enter a descriptive name to identify the integration (e.g., "CRM Integration" or "Website Bot").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Your Token">
    Copy the generated API key immediately.

    <Warning>

    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security Best Practices

To keep your account secure, follow these guidelines:

- **Never share keys**: Do not share API keys publicly or commit them to version control repositories.
- **Rotate periodically**: Update your keys regularly to reduce security risks.
- **Deactivate unused keys**: Delete any keys that are no longer required for active integrations.
- **Use unique keys**: Assign a different key to each third-party tool for better tracking and security.
