## Creating Templates

To initiate a new approval request, click the **"New template"** button in the top right corner of the dashboard. Use the following sections to define your message structure:

<Info>
  **Approval Process:** By default, all templates are submitted under the **Utility** category. Review typically takes up to **24 hours**, though newly connected WhatsApp channels may experience longer wait times.
</Info>

### Basic Information

- **Name**: Enter a descriptive, internal name for your template to help your team identify it quickly.
- **WhatsApp Channel**: Select the specific WhatsApp channel for this template. Note that a template can only be associated with one WhatsApp channel at a time.

### Header (Optional)

Headers appear at the very top of your message. You can choose one of the following formats:

#### Text Header

Text headers allow for a short title at the top of your message.

<Info>
  Supports a maximum of **one** variable. WhatsApp formatting characters (like bold or italics) are not supported.
</Info>

#### Media Header (Image, Video, Document)

Include a visual or document-based element.

- **Image**: Supported formats: **JPG, JPEG, PNG**. Max size: **5MB**.
- **Video**: Supported formats: **MP4, 3GP**. Max size: **16MB**.
- **Document**: Supported formats: **PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG, MP4**. Max size: **100MB**.

### Message Body

The body is the primary content and the only required component. You can enhance your message using [WhatsApp formatting](https://faq.whatsapp.com/539178204879377) and parameters (contact attributes and variables):

- **Contact Attributes**: Click the **"\<\>"** icon to insert dynamic data like First Name or Address. These are automatically replaced with the recipient's specific information.
- **Variables**: Click the **"\<\>"** icon and select **"Add new variable"** to include custom data like Order IDs or Pricing that can be passed via API or Automations.

### Footer (Optional)

A short line of grey text at the bottom of your message. This is commonly used for signatures or "Reply STOP to unsubscribe" notices.

### Buttons

Interactive buttons drive higher engagement. You can add up to **10 buttons** in total across these types:

<Info>
  If you add more than 3 buttons, WhatsApp displays the first 2 and collapses the rest into a **"See all options"** menu.
</Info>

#### Quick Reply

A preset response button. When clicked, it sends the button text as a reply message.

<Info>
  Highly effective in [Automations](https://docs.heyy.io/quick-start/automations/getting-started) to trigger specific flows.

## Updating Templates

At this time, only the **name** of an existing template can be edited. To change the content, header, or buttons, you must create a new template.

<Info>
  **Why can't I edit template content?** Modifying a template triggers a new Meta approval process which often results in technical errors or indefinite downtime. To ensure your active automations and business flows remain stable, we require the creation of a new template for any content changes.
