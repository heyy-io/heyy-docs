## Template Overview

Meta requires pre-approved templates to initiate conversations with users. WhatsApp templates are the only message type allowed outside of the [24-hour customer service window](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/messages/send-messages#customer-service-windows). They are essential for sending bulk broadcasts or reaching out to users when no active session exists.

Your templates table provides a high-level view of your library:

- **Name**: The unique identifier for your template.
- **Channel**: The specific WhatsApp Business account associated with the template.
- **Status**: The current approval state (Active, Pending, or Rejected).
- **Category**: The template classification (Marketing, Utility, or Authentication).
- **Created At**: The timestamp of the template's creation.

## Updating Templates

At this time, only the **name** of an existing template can be edited. To change the content, header, or buttons of a template, please create a new one.

<Info>
  **Why can't I edit template content?** Modifying an existing template triggers a new Meta approval process. This often leads to extended downtime or technical errors where a template remains disabled indefinitely, disrupting your business automations and active campaigns. Creating a new template ensures your existing flows remain stable.
