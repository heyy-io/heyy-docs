## 1. Left Sidebar – Contact Views

On the left sidebar, you’ll find your contact views. These make it easier to organize and filter your contact list.

### Default and Custom Views

- **All Contacts** – Shows every contact in your Hub.  
- **Custom Views** – Lets you group contacts by criteria that matter to you (e.g., subscribed vs. unsubscribed users, free trial users, contacts with certain labels, etc.).

### Creating a Custom View

1. Go to the **Contacts** tab.  
2. At the top of the contact list, click the **Filter** button.  
3. Choose filter conditions such as:  
   - First Name / Last Name  
   - Email  
   - Subscription Status  
   - Labels  
   - Any other available parameter  
4. Add multiple conditions if you need to refine further.  
   - **Example:** `First Name = John AND Subscription Status = Subscribed`.  
5. Click **Save View**.  
6. Name your view (e.g., “Free Trial Users”) and it will appear in your sidebar for quick access.  

<Tip>
Custom views make it simple to return to important groups of contacts without re-applying filters every time.
