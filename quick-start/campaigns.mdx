The **Campaigns** tab is where you create, manage, and track your outreach campaigns. It gives you a clear overview of past and ongoing campaigns, their performance, and the audiences they target.

## A.  Left Sidebar

The left sidebar helps you filter and organize your campaigns:

- **All Campaigns** â€“ Displays every campaign in your workspace.  
- **Views** â€“ Access predefined views. For now we have a few system views, you canâ€™t save your own.

- **Campaign Type** â€“ Whether itâ€™s scheduled, recurring, or one-off  
- **Last Execution Status** â€“ The most recent result (e.g., completed, in progress, failed)  
- **Total Recipients** â€“ Number of contacts included in the campaign  
- **Created At** â€“ The date the campaign was first created

## C.  Detailed Campaign View

Inside a campaign, you can see performance and delivery details, including:

- **Total audience size** â€“ How many contacts were in the campaign  
- **Messages sent** â€“ The number of contacts who received the campaign  
- **Deliveries** â€“ Successful message deliveries  
- **Failures** â€“ Messages that failed to deliver  
- **Reads** â€“ How many people opened/read the campaign  

This view helps you measure campaign effectiveness and troubleshoot issues.

## D.  Creating a New Campaign

To create a campaign:

1. **Enter a Campaign Name** â€“ Give your campaign a clear, descriptive title.  
2. **Select a Workflow** â€“ Choose a predefined workflow from the drop-down menu.  
   <Note>
   Every campaign requires a workflow to run.
   </Note>

4. **Choose the Campaign Type**  
   - **Scheduled** â€“ Runs once at a specific time  
   - **Recurring** â€“ Runs automatically on a repeating schedule  

   <Tip>
   Selecting either option lets you define the exact timing and recurrence settings. You can only use one option at a time (either Scheduled or Recurring) and not both.
   </Tip>

6. **Select Recipients / Audience** â€“ Define who should receive the campaign.  
7. **Create Campaign** â€“ Finalize and activate your campaign.  

<Note>
Clicking "Create Campaign" will not start the campaign automatically. To start a campaign, go to Campaigns page, click on the individual campaign and click Start Campaign at the top right corner of the page to start the campaign. Campaigns are reusable, so you can run it as many times as you want.

## Why Campaigns Matter

Campaigns give you a structured way to:

- Reach specific audiences with tailored messages  
- Automate outreach without manual sending  
- Track effectiveness with delivery and engagement insights  
- Optimize future campaigns with performance data  

<Tip>
Start simple with a one-off small campaigns. Once youâ€™re comfortable, explore with bigger audiences using the scheduled or recurring campaigns to automate ongoing communication with your audience.
